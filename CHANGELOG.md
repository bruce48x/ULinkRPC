# Changelog

## 0.13.5

- Fixed generated client overload forwarding so parameterless client calls correctly delegate to the `CancellationToken` overload instead of recursing.
- Tightened contract validation to fail fast when RPC services or callback contracts are declared without valid RPC methods.
- Added behavior-level generator tests that compile and execute generated client code, not just compile it.
