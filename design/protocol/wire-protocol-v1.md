# ULinkRPC Wire Protocol v1

Status: draft stability contract

Date: 2026-06-04

## Scope

This document defines the ULinkRPC RPC envelope wire format. The envelope format describes the bytes produced and consumed by `RpcEnvelopeCodec`.

This document does not define:

- concrete transport framing, such as TCP length prefixes, WebSocket messages, or KCP handshakes
- payload serializer formats, such as JSON or MemoryPack DTO bytes
- optional security transforms, such as compression and encryption wrapping

The current envelope format has no explicit version field. From this document forward, the existing unversioned envelope format is treated as wire protocol v1. Breaking changes to this format require a future protocol version or an explicit migration path.

## Primitive Encoding

- `byte`: unsigned 8-bit value.
- `int32`: signed 32-bit integer, big-endian.
- `uint32`: unsigned 32-bit integer, big-endian.
- `int64`: signed 64-bit integer, big-endian.
- UTF-8 strings are encoded as an `int32` byte length followed by that many UTF-8 bytes.
- Payload bytes are opaque to the envelope layer and are produced by the configured `IRpcSerializer`.

The maximum accepted RPC envelope payload length is `RpcProtocolLimits.DefaultMaxPayloadSize`, currently 64 MiB.

## Frame Types

| Value | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | `Request` |
| `2` | `Response` |
| `3` | `Push` |
| `4` | `KeepAlivePing` |
| `5` | `KeepAlivePong` |

These numeric values are stable v1 wire values and must not be reused for different meanings.

## Request Frame

Client-to-server RPC request.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameType` | `byte` | Must be `1`. |
| `RequestId` | `uint32` | Client-assigned correlation id. |
| `ServiceId` | `int32` | Stable service id from `[RpcService]`. |
| `MethodId` | `int32` | Stable method id from `[RpcMethod]`. |
| `PayloadLength` | `int32` | Number of payload bytes. |
| `Payload` | `byte[PayloadLength]` | Serialized request DTO bytes. |

Example:

```text
01                                      FrameType=Request
00 00 00 01                             RequestId=1
00 00 00 02                             ServiceId=2
00 00 00 03                             MethodId=3
00 00 00 03                             PayloadLength=3
AA BB CC                                Payload
```

## Response Frame

Server-to-client RPC response.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameType` | `byte` | Must be `2`. |
| `RequestId` | `uint32` | Request id being answered. |
| `Status` | `byte` | RPC response status. |
| `PayloadLength` | `int32` | Number of payload bytes. |
| `Payload` | `byte[PayloadLength]` | Serialized return DTO bytes, often empty for failures. |
| `HasError` | `byte` | `0` means no error string; non-zero means an error string follows. |
| `ErrorLength` | `int32` | Present only when `HasError` is non-zero. |
| `ErrorUtf8` | `byte[ErrorLength]` | Present only when `HasError` is non-zero. |

Status values:

| Value | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `Ok` | Request completed successfully. |
| `1` | `NotFound` | Target service or method was not found. |
| `2` | `Exception` | Server failed while handling the request. |

Example response with no error string:

```text
02                                      FrameType=Response
01 02 03 04                             RequestId=0x01020304
00                                      Status=Ok
00 00 00 02                             PayloadLength=2
10 20                                   Payload
00                                      HasError=false
```

Example response with an error string:

```text
02                                      FrameType=Response
00 00 00 07                             RequestId=7
02                                      Status=Exception
00 00 00 00                             PayloadLength=0
01                                      HasError=true
00 00 00 04                             ErrorLength=4
66 61 69 6C                             ErrorUtf8="fail"
```

## Push Frame

Server-to-client push notification. Push frames do not carry a request id.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameType` | `byte` | Must be `3`. |
| `ServiceId` | `int32` | Stable service id associated with the notification contract. |
| `MethodId` | `int32` | Stable notification method id from `[RpcNotification]`. |
| `PayloadLength` | `int32` | Number of payload bytes. |
| `Payload` | `byte[PayloadLength]` | Serialized notification DTO bytes. |

Example:

```text
03                                      FrameType=Push
00 00 00 02                             ServiceId=2
00 00 00 03                             MethodId=3
00 00 00 02                             PayloadLength=2
AA BB                                   Payload
```

## Keepalive Frames

Keepalive timestamps use UTC ticks stored as `int64`.

Ping:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameType` | `byte` | Must be `4`. |
| `TimestampTicksUtc` | `int64` | Sender timestamp. |

Pong:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameType` | `byte` | Must be `5`. |
| `TimestampTicksUtc` | `int64` | Timestamp copied from the matching ping. |

## Decode Failure Rules

The v1 decoder rejects malformed envelopes:

- empty frame data
- unexpected frame type for the requested decode method
- negative payload or error string lengths
- payload or error string lengths above the configured maximum
- declared lengths that exceed remaining frame bytes
- extra trailing bytes after a complete envelope

Transport/session code may close the connection after decode failures. Application code should treat malformed envelope bytes as protocol errors, not business failures.

## Compatibility Rules

- Existing frame type values must not change.
- Existing field order, field size, and big-endian integer encoding must not change.
- `RequestId`, `ServiceId`, `MethodId`, and `PayloadLength` meanings must not change.
- Published service ids, method ids, and push ids must not be reused for different meanings.
- New frame types or status values require explicit old-peer behavior documentation.
- Breaking changes to v1 require a new protocol version or a documented compatibility window.
